# Codecademy-Biodiversity-Project

This is a semi-guided project from the Codecademy Data Science Foundations career path. General project steps such as "Project Scoping" and "Explore and Explain Data" were provided, but no specific instructions. The goal of this project is to investigate data about endangered species in selected U.S. national parks to look for patterns in species, categories, or locations using Python Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn.

Raw Data: observations.csv and species.csv
